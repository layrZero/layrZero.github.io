Initiating integration with Upstox's API generally involves several key steps:

### Generating API Key and API Secret

**API Key Registration**: Developers must register for an API key through Upstox Accounts - Developer Apps portal, which serves as the authentication mechanism for API requests.

Goto the [Upstox Accounts -  Developer Apps](https://account.upstox.com/developer/apps) Portal and login with your upstox login credentials.&#x20;

Press Create New App and&#x20;

Enter the App name, Redirect the URL and select I accept the terms and conditions check box, and press the Done button

Save the generated apikey and apisecret. Later we will be adding the apikey in the [environmental variable](https://docs.openalgo.in/getting-started/windows-installation/environmental-variables) along with the redirect url

Here is a sample of how the details would appear in a .env file for reference:

```
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_api_secret_here'
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/upstox/callback'
```



Integrating OpenAlgo with Upstox'sAPI opens up possibilities for automated trading strategies, providing a powerful tool for traders and developers to exploit market opportunities efficiently. It's essential to follow best practices for API integration, including handling rate limits, managing API keys securely, and ensuring robust error handling and logging mechanisms are in place.
