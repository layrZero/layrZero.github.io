### Step 1: Enable TOTP (Two-Factor Authentication)

Save the **Secret Key** and enable **TOTP**.

> This is required for secure API login during authentication.

### Step 2: Create API Applications

Login to [XTS Developer Portal](https://xts.compositedge.com/dashboard#!/login).

Once logged in:

1. Go to `My App` > `Create New Application`

/>

1. Create two separate apps:
   * **Interactive Order API**
   * **Market Data API**

<img
  src={require('@site/static/img/assets/image (99).png').default}
/>

#### Details to Fill:

* **App Name**: OpenAlgo
* **App Description**: OpenAlgo
* **Redirect URL(required only for Interactive Order API)**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/compositedge/callback`
* **Company Name**: OpenAlgo (or your own)
* Choose the correct **API Package** depending on the app (Order or Market Data).

/>

Once submitted, wait for approval from the broker. After approval, the status will turn **Active**.

***

### Step 3: Setup Environment Variables

Refer to the `.sample.env` file in your OpenAlgo folder and prepare your `.env` as follows:

```bash
# Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_BROKER_ORDER_API_KEY'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'YOUR_ORDER_API_SECRET'

BROKER_API_KEY_MARKET = 'YOUR_BROKER_MARKET_API_KEY'
BROKER_API_SECRET_MARKET = 'YOUR_BROKER_MARKET_API_SECRET'

REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/compositedge/callback'
```

Replace the values with actual credentials shown on your developer dashboard once approved.

***

### Step 4: Start OpenAlgo

Once all environment variables are set and your apps are **Active**, you can now start OpenAlgo.

> Ensure you have installed dependencies and set up the broker configuration properly. OpenAlgo will now be able to place orders and fetch market data through Compositedge's XTS API.
