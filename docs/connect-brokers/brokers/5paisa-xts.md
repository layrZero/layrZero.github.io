```bash
# Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_BROKER_ORDER_API_KEY'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'YOUR_ORDER_API_SECRET'

BROKER_API_KEY_MARKET = 'YOUR_BROKER_MARKET_API_KEY'
BROKER_API_SECRET_MARKET = 'YOUR_BROKER_MARKET_API_SECRET'

REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/fivepaisaxts/callback'
```

Replace the values with actual credentials shown on your developer dashboard once approved.
