1. **Login to AliceBlue ANT Website**
   * Navigate to the [AliceBlue ANT website.](https://ant.aliceblueonline.com/)
   * Enter your credentials to log in.
2. **Access API Key Section**
   * On the top right corner, click on **Apps**.
   * Select the **API Key** tab.
3. **Generate API Key**
   * If you don’t already have an API key, generate a new one by following the on-screen instructions.
   * Note down the **API Secret Key** as it will be required for configuring the `.env` file.

### Configuring the `.env` File

The AliceBlue login user ID is used as the API key. Below is a sample configuration for the `.env` file:

```
# AliceBlue Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_client_id'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_api_secret_here'
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/aliceblue/callback'

```

Replace `your_client_id` with your AliceBlue login user ID and `your_api_secret_here` with the generated API secret key.

#### Important Notes

* Ensure that your **API Secret Key** is stored securely and is not shared publicly.
* The **REDIRECT\_URL** should match the one registered with your API application.

Follow these steps to integrate AliceBlue with OpenAlgo successfully. If you encounter any issues, refer to the AliceBlue API documentation for further assistance.
