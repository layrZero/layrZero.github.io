It enables traders to write custom trading rules, indicators, and algorithms. AFL is designed to be easy to learn and fast to execute, making it ideal for developing complex trading strategies without requiring extensive programming knowledge.

This feature is crucial for algorithmic trading, as it helps identify and refine effective strategies while minimizing risk.
4. **Optimization**: Along with backtesting, AmiBroker offers optimization features that enable traders to fine-tune their strategies by testing various parameters. This process helps in identifying the most effective settings for maximum profitability or efficiency.
5. **Automation and Execution**: AmiBroker can be integrated with trading platforms for automated trading. It can send orders directly to the market based on the rules defined in the AFL scripts, enabling fully automated, hands-off trading.
6. **Scalability and Speed**: The software is designed for efficiency, able to handle large volumes of data and execute trading strategies with minimal delay. This is crucial for high-frequency trading strategies that rely on speed and efficiency.
